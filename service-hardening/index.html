# $ whoami

* Arch Linux Developer

---

# Agenda

* Systemd Service

---

# Why

* Default systemd service are not restricted
* No isolation between services 

---

# Benefits

* Isolate processes
* Reduce impact of security issues

???

Uses seccomp for syscall/capability filtering

---

# Linux features

* cgroups
* Namespaces
* capabilities

---

# Considerations

* threat analysis
* not a magic bullet

???

Does not prevent SQLi or Kernel bypass

---

# Basic service

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Quassel IRC Service
After=postgresql.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/quasselcore

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
``` 

---

# Limit Privileges

```bash
[Service]
User=quassel

DynamicUser=true

NoNewPrivileges=
```

???

DynamicUser is useful for services which creates no files on disk and can be
used in combination with EnvironmentFile=/etc/service.cfg.

prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1)
promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without the execve(2) call.

# Filesystem Access

```bash
[Service]
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true

PrivateDevices=true
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectControlGroups=true

# Filtering
ReadWritePaths=
ReadOnlyPaths=
InaccessiblePaths=
```

---

# System Calls

```bash
[Service]
SystemCallFilter=~@reboot
```

```bash
# List of system calls to filter on
systemd-analyze syscall-filter
```

---

# Network hardening


```bash
[Service]
PrivateNetwork=true
```

```bash
[Service]
IPAddressAllow=localhost
IPAddressDeny=any
```

???

Network restrictions use eBPF and requires underlying kernel support.

---

# Capabilities

```bash
CapabilityBoundingSet=
CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_KILL
```

???

Useful for root services to remove capabilities which are not required. Uses
the capabilities API ofinux.

---

# Various

```bash
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true
SystemCallArchitectures=native
```

???

UMask=

---

# Verify

```bash
$ systemd-analyze security

  NAME                     DESCRIPTION                               
✗ PrivateNetwork=          Service has access to the host's network  
✗ User=/DynamicUser=       Service runs as root user                 
✓ PrivateDevices=          Service has no access to hardware devices
