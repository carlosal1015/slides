# $ whoami

* Arch Linux Developer

---

# Why

* Default systemd service are not restricted
* No isolation between services

???

- Isolate processes
- Reduce impact of security issues

---

# How

* cgroups
* Namespaces
* capabilities

???

Uses seccomp for syscall/capability filtering
Uses capabilities for removing or adding capabilities such as CAP_SETUID, .. CAP_SYS_BOOT, CAP_SYS_MODULE
Uses mprotect - set memory mapping's PROT_READ, PROT_EXEC, PROT_WRITE

---

# Considerations

* not a magic bullet
* application security > systemd service hardening

???

Does not prevent SQLi, Kernel bypass, RCE or XSS, CRSF, broken auth flows

STRIDE. STRIDE is an acronym consisting of the following six categories:
- spoofing identity => no
- tampering with data => reduced
- repudiation
- information disclosure => reduced
- denial of service => maybe
- elevation of privilege => reduced

# Basic service

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Quassel IRC Service
After=postgresql.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/quasselcore

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
``` 

---

# Limit Privileges

```bash
[Service]
User=quassel

DynamicUser=true

NoNewPrivileges=
```

???

DynamicUser is useful for services which creates no files on disk and can be
used in combination with EnvironmentFile=/etc/service.cfg.

prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1)
promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without the execve(2) call.

---

# Filesystem Access

```bash
[Service]
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true

PrivateDevices=true
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectControlGroups=true

# Filtering
ReadWritePaths=
ReadOnlyPaths=
InaccessiblePaths=
```

---

# System Calls

```bash
[Service]
SystemCallFilter=~@reboot
```

```bash
# List of system calls to filter on
systemd-analyze syscall-filter
```

---

# Network hardening


```bash
[Service]
PrivateNetwork=true
```

```bash
[Service]
IPAddressAllow=localhost
IPAddressDeny=any
```

???

Network restrictions use eBPF and requires underlying kernel support.

---

# Capabilities

```bash
CapabilityBoundingSet=
CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_KILL
```

???

Useful for root services to remove capabilities which are not required. Uses
the capabilities API ofinux.

---

# Various

```bash
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true
SystemCallArchitectures=native
```

???

UMask=

---

# Verify

```bash
$ systemd-analyze security

  NAME                     DESCRIPTION                               
✗ PrivateNetwork=          Service has access to the host's network  
✗ User=/DynamicUser=       Service runs as root user                 
✓ PrivateDevices=          Service has no access to hardware devices
