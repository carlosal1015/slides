---

# Mirroring

* Two tier system
* Tier 1 syncs from archlinux.org (rsync)
* Tier 2 syncs from Tier 1

---

# Archweb mirror monitoring 

* Periodically fetches lastsync to determine mirrors status
* Pings mirrors from several locations

https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/kernel.org/212/

---

# Communcation

* mail (mail.archlinux.org)
* quassel (quassel.archlinux.org)
* matrix (matrix.archlinux.org)

---

# AUR

* The Arch User Repository
* Written in PHP/Python
* Hosted on one dedicated server (luna)
* Trusted user voting
* Cgit for the repositories

???

- cgit / performance issues
- small mysql db still! 300 MB

---

# DBscripts

* Repository managament
* Handles addition/removal/moving of packages to the repository

---

# Wiki

* Private fork with some theming/branding
* 18.833 pages
* 30.000 users
* Biggest Database (7GB)

---

# BBS (FluxBB)

* Forum
* 88.300 registered users
* 1.700.000 posts
* ~ 5 GB DB

---

# Bugtracker (flyspray)

* Currently using flyspray
* Want to migrate to bugzilla

---

# Backups

* Borg is used for backups
* One backup server (vostok)
* ~3 TB disk

---

# Extra mirrors

Provides mirrors underrepresented countries hosted on the PIA boxes

---

# Security Tracker

* Tracks CVE for Arch Linux packages
* Separate team maintains https://security.archlinux.org

---

# Security tracker

* Python-flask miminal webservice
* Tracks CVE's, Generates Advisory's
* JSON API for advisories, see arch-audit

???

Mention that we need people in our security tracking team.

---

# Archive

https://archive.archlinux.org

* 2.1 TB of archived packages
* Used for reproducible builds and downgrades
* Tooling https://github.com/archlinux/archivetools

???

Used to grow endlessly, had to write a custom script to remove unreferenced files
for reproducible builds. Partly uploaded to archive.org

---

# Arch Vagrant

* Automated building of VBox images for vagrant

---

# Mailman

* self hosted mailman hosted for all our mailing lists

---

# Git repo

* Git repo for various projects

---

# Misc

* Staging ground for archweb
* Patchwork instance
* Kanboard
* Torrent tracker
* Phrik

---

# Monitoring

* Zabbix
* Grafana dasbhoard

???

Demo dashboard

# Monitoring - Services

* custom scripts for monitoring systemd units
* monitor cpu/memory usage per service
* monitor failed units

???

Both are handled by a Python script with the dbus module to talk
to systemd.

---

# Monitoring - Rest

* Perl scripts for monitoring
* Borg monitoring
* MySQL user/db status
* Arch Audit for security issues

???

We've written custom tooling to monitor various things of interest.


---

# Monitoring - Results!

* Heavy MySQL usage for the AUR
* Quicker security patching
* Service monitoring spotted issue in cgit

???

Heavy MySQL stats ~ 300% CPU, resolved by nginx caching.
Heavy CPU usage for cgit, due to not git gc'ing.

---

# Management

* Ansible is used to manage most of the servers
* Managed by a small devops team (8 persons)

Mailing list
https://lists.archlinux.org/listinfo/arch-devops

Ansible code
https://git.archlinux.org/infrastructure.git/

---

# Ansible role

* pacman is supported!
* basic role to deploy our basic server
* deploys ssh/tools/users/pubkeys

---

# Terraform

* Hetzner could VPS managed by terraform
* Packager image

---

# Current Problems

* User management
* Security
* Lack of overview
* Old unmaintained stuff in operation (flyspray, bbs, planet, mailman 2)
* Messy Ansible setup
* Mix between VPS/dedicated machines
* Unmanaged Luna server (cgit, AUR, BBS)
* Hard to mirror Git repos to/from GitHub (harder for contribs)
* No CI/CD (also for Ansible (AWX)?)
* No automated compiling/packaging

---

# Future

* Terraform more
* Ansible more
* Automate more
* IAM for users (one of Keycloak, FreeIPA, 389ds)
* GitLab
* Bugzilla
* More VPS: Migrating from Luna/Soyuz
